## Discord Bot
very creative name... I know...

in order to use the bot create a ``conf.json`` file at the root of the repo and put this in it
```
{
    "token": "<your token goes here>",
    "modRoleID": "<role id for your chosen role>",
    "botLogChannelID": <channel ID for the bot event log>
}
```
